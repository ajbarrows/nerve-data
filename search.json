    "text": "Getting data into a your /data directory\n\nWorking directly on the VACC\nIf you plan to do your data cleaning, exploration, analysis, and reporting entirely on the VACC (more on this later), you can simply create a symbolic link between the /data directory in your project and the shared NERVE Lab data repository. A symbolic link is just like a Windows or macOS shortcut, but it’s created using the terminal:\nln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symlink\nTo be concrete (assuming your project is caled my_project):\ncd my_project\nln -s /users/a/j/ajbarrow/scratch/data/ABCD data/raw\nThis will create a link between the repository that holds /ABCD and your project’s /data/raw folder. This means that you will access data from your local /data/raw/ folder – as will anyone who wants to reproduce your results!\n\n\nWorking on your local computer\nIf you don’t plan to work on the VACC directly (or if you will prototype your code on a local machine and possibly run analyses on the VACC later), you will need to copy data to your local machine 2. There are several methods for doing this. In any case, I strongly recommend that you maintain the original file structure.\n\nrsync (recommended)\nLinux and macOS have a built in tool called “remote sync” (rsync) which synchronizes file trees, often between “local” (e.g., your laptop) and “remote” (e.g., the VACC) resources. rsync commands take the form\nrsync [option] source destination\nI encourage you to become familiar with the various options used in rsync, but I will suggest a common implementation using teh -a (“archive”) flag which contains a number of common options (e.g., ensures all subdirectories are copied, preserves symlinks, and preserves ownership and permissions), the -v (“verbose”) flag that prints all errors and warnings, and the -P flag, which shows an interactive progress bar.\nFrom my local machine:\ncd my_project\nrsync -avP \\\\ \n    vacc:/users/a/j/ajbarrow/scratch/data/ABCD/6.0/dairc/rawdata/phenotype data/raw\nNote The \\\\ indicates a multi-line command. This is not necessary.\nOther note You will likely have to replace vacc with your_netid@login.vacc.uvm.edu.\n\n\nOpen OnDemand (GUI-based alternative)\nIn order to use Open OnDemand, you need to be on campus or connected to UVM’s VPN."
